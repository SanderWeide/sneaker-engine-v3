## Key Angular Principles

### Component Architecture
- Use standalone components (default in Angular v20+)
- Do NOT set `standalone: true` in decorators
- Use signals for state management
- Use `input()` and `output()` functions instead of decorators
- Use `computed()` for derived state
- Set `changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush`
- Use host object instead of `@HostBinding` and `@HostListener`

### Templates
- Use native control flow: `@if`, `@for`, `@switch` (not `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`, `*ngSwitch`)
- Use `async` pipe for observables
- Use class and style bindings (not `ngClass` or `ngStyle`)
- No arrow functions in templates
- No assumptions about browser globals in templates

### Services & DI
- Use `inject()` function instead of constructor injection
- All services should be `providedIn: 'root'`
- Design around single responsibility

### TypeScript
- Use strict type checking
- Avoid `any`, use `unknown` when uncertain
- Prefer type inference when obvious

### Accessibility
- Must pass AXE checks
- Must follow WCAG AA standards
- Include ARIA attributes where needed
